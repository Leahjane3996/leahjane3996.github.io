      <div class="about-content1">

        <p class="about"> Last winter my husband and I were driving up to the mountains for a (kid free!!) day of skiing.  I was rambling about how <strong>I missed teaching but wasn’t sure the classroom would be the right place for me once I decide to go back to work after two plus years of being a stay-at-home mom.</strong>  </p>
        <p>I talked about all of the things I loved about teaching - creating the lessons, making the smart board presentations, designing and completing projects, using new technologies to teach online, and of course the kids. <strong> It became apparent that what I loved so much about teaching was the process.</strong> Learning and researching about a topic, planning how I would deliver that information to kids, creating and designing materials, and finally executing a project.  I didn’t know it at the time, but it is a process that is very similar to the one that we go through as designers. </p>

        <p>After a suggestion to consider web design from my husband and extensive research <strong>I felt like there was something out there for me that that could really fit my lifestyle and tap into what I loved to do.</strong> I love creating.  I love learning about new things and using that knowledge to execute a project.  I enjoy problem solving and finding unique solutions to a problem.  Mostly, I love to help others through my creations and knowledge.  <span style="color: #ECA2B4">As a web designer, I am passionate about making information accessible and beautiful.</span></p>
