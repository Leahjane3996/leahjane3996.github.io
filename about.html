        <p> Last winter my husband and I were driving up to the mountains for a (kid free!!) day of skiing.  I was rambling about how I missed teaching but wasn’t sure the classroom would be the right place for me once I decide to go back to work after two plus years of being a stay-at-home mom.  I talked about all of the things I loved about teaching - the lessons, making the smart board presentations,designing and completing projects, using new technologies to teach online, and of course the kids.  It became apparent that what I loved so much about teaching was the process.  Learning and researching about a topic, planning how I would deliver that information to kids, creating and designing materials, and finally executing a project.  I didn’t know it at the time, but it is a process that is very similar to the one that we go through as designers.<br>
          After a suggestion to consider web design and extensive research I felt like there was something out there for me that that could really fit my lifestyle and tap into what I loved to do.  I love creating.  I love learning about new things and using that knowledge to execute a project.  I enjoy problem solving and finding unique solutions to a problem.  Mostly, I love to help others through my creations and knowledge.  As a web designer, I am passionate about making information accessible and beautiful.
