        <p>The first step in my research process was to learn about other competitors in the market.  I studied Google Drive, Pinterest, and Dropbox to assess strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats (Swot Analysis).
          I then found an area that there was an opportunity for a new competitor to enter which led me to my idea of Home Away.  Some key points I took away for my app were:</p>

                    <p class="margin"> During the creation of Sweet Home, I found user testing really helpful.  I learned that a lot of designs that I like the look of might not be the most functional or might not be appealing to other people.  I think the User survey was really helpful in starting off the project and deciding what to do, and preference tests and usability tests were really helpful along the way.
                      I learned a lot about design in general and what is accepted among the design community.  Overall, I think the most important thing I realized was how important spacing and size and consistency are to help the design look polished and professional.
