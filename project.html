      <h1> Solution </h1>
      <p> Home Away is a place for home lovers to be inspired and also a social network.  Users are able to browse different ideas from friends or search terms.  They can then save and organize ideas they like.  The final part is the capacity to share and also communicate opinions with friends and family.</p>

    <section class="competitive-analysis">
      <h1>Competitive Analysis </h1>
      <p>The first step in my research process was to learn about other competitors in the market.  I studied Google Drive, Pinterest, and Dropbox to assess strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats (Swot Analysis).  I then found an area that there was an opportunity for a new competitor to enter which led me to my idea of Home Away.  Some key points I took away for my app were:

        Visually appealing (picture organization)
        Focused and organized
        Free storage
        Ability to collaborate

    <section class="user-research">
      <h1>User Research </h1>
      <p>Next, I created and distributed a survey to find out if my idea for Home Away would appeal to the general public.  Most people are familar with and using cloud storage apps.  They also do work on their  homes.  86% would be open to using a new home improvement application, and the majority of people surveyed already get most of their home improvement inspiration from the internet.  These users want to find content on the web, save it, and organize it.  Some of the users would like to share and collaborate with others on this as well.  Of these participants, a lot of them said they use these apps when they want to start a new project.  All of this research leads me to believe a home improvement cloud storage application would be successful.

    <section class="user-stories">
      <h1>User Stories </h1>
      <p>Now that I had information about the type of web application my users were interested in it was time to develop User Stories to help me decide which features would be most important for this site.  I came up with user stories of high importance and also low and medium importances.  This gave me a place to start my focus on and some things to think about for future additions to the project.
        The most important features were for the user to be able to
        Get inspired
        Save
        Share

    <section class= "conclusion">
      <h1>Conclusion </H1>
        <p> During the creation of Sweet Home, I found user testing really helpful.  I learned that a lot of designs that I like the look of might not be the most functional or might not be appealing to other people.  I think the User survey was really helpful in starting off the project and deciding what to do, and preference tests and usability tests were really helpful along the way.
          I learned a lot about design in general and what is accepted among the design community.  Overall, I think the most important thing I realized was how important spacing and size and consistency are to help the design look polished and professional.  I needed to seek out a lot of feedback on this project, and I got used to taking all the opinions with a grain of salt and also combining other peopleâ€™s ideas with my own to make the best product.
